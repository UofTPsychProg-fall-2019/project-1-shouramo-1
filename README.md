ORE = other race effect 

In this experiment, I will presenting two faces on screen at a time (with a fixation cross in the middled). 

The objective is to rate the faces on a similarity scale from 1-7 (1 = very different looking, 7 = very similar) 
the participants will undergo 1 training block (5 trials), 5 experimental blocks (87 trials each, as 87 x 5 is 435, and that
is the number of pair combinations possible with 30 faces).

I will be running this experiment in 2 different sessions (first session will consist of two sections, first section will
include East Asian Stimuli only, second section will include Caucasian stimuli only, and the second session will include a mix). 

The code provided (with stimuli) is for the East Asian section only.

Each session will take around 1 hour to complete (the code provided will take half the amount, as I spoke to one of the 
instructors and they advised I only include the first section of the first session, since the second section of the first session and 
the second sessions are identical in terms of paradigm).
